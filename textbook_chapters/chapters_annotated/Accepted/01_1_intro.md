Chapter 1: Introduction
=======================

 There are three core aspects of effective data
analysis: exploration, prediction, and inference.

**In this endeavor, we will combine two essential tools: computation and
randomization.** For example, we may want to understand climate change trends
using temperature observations.  

 
The discipline of statistics has long addressed the same fundamental challenge
as data science: how to draw **robust conclusions about the world using incomplete
information. **

Observation -> conclusion, precise

Inheriting from statistics: 

1. testing hypotheses, 
2. estimating confidence, 
3. and predicting unknown quantities.

Data science extends the field of statistics via CS - big data and ML and resampling âˆˆ fast databases.
