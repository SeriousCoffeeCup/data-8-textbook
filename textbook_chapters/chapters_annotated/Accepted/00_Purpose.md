This folder's purpose:
Deletional reading is notetaking by aggressively deleting and replacing the contents of the textbook.


Archive contains stuff I've read once, and do not think needs to be reread. 
    Stuff for rereading is still out in main folder.

Looks like I've also stopped to turn functions into generic functions - those I can memorize and bring into any context 
    But this will burn too much time
